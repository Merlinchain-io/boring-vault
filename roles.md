   - Custom decimals support
   - Transfer hooks for additional control

2. **Access Control**
   - Role-based authorization (Auth)
   - Manager functions for arbitrary calls
   - Minter/Burner roles for share management

3. **Asset Management**

### Security Considerations

1. **Manager Functions**
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
       participant M as Manager
       participant G as Governance
       participant T as Target
       
       M->>G: manage(target, data, value)
       G->>T: functionCallWithValue
       T-->>G: result
       G-->>M: result
   ```
   - Allows arbitrary function calls
   - Requires proper authorization
   - Potential for delegatecall attacks

2. **Share Management**
   ```mermaid
   sequenceDiagram
       participant A as Authorized
       participant G as Governance
       participant U as User
       
       A->>G: enter(from, asset, amount, to, shares)
       G->>U: safeTransferFrom
       G->>G: _mint
   ```
   - Controlled by MINTER_ROLE
   - Safe transfer implementations
   - Event emission for tracking

3. **Transfer Hooks**
   ```mermaid
   graph LR
       A[Transfer] --> B[BeforeTransferHook]
       A --> C[ShareLocker]
       B --> D[Validation]
       C --> E[Restrictions]
   ```
   - Pre-transfer validation
   - Share locking mechanisms
   - Custom transfer rules

### Security Measures

1. **Access Control**

   - Transfer hook validations

2. **Asset Safety**
   - Safe transfer implementations
   - Event logging
   - Balance checks

3. **Transfer Protection**
   - Pre-transfer hooks
   - Share locking
   - EIP712 signatures

4. **Governance Features**
   - Voting power tracking

   - Custom decimal handling

## Security Analysis

### 1. Rate Provider Manipulation (FALSE POSITIVE)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Attacker
    participant RP as RateProvider
    participant AC as Accountant
    participant V as Vault
    
    A->>RP: Deploy Malicious RateProvider
    A->>AC: Set RateProvider (requires auth)
    AC->>RP: getRate()
    RP-->>AC: Manipulated Rate
    AC->>V: Update Exchange Rate
    V->>V: Incorrect Asset Calculations
```

**Why False Positive:**
1. Rate providers require authorization through `setRateProviderData`
2. Rate changes are bounded by `allowedExchangeRateChangeUpper` and `allowedExchangeRateChangeLower`
3. Rate updates have minimum delay requirements
4. Contract uses safe math operations
5. Rate changes are monitored and validated

### 2. Cross-Chain Rate Manipulation (FALSE POSITIVE)

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Attacker] --> B[CrossChain Rate Provider]
    B --> C[Mainnet Rate]
    C --> D[Vault Operations]
    D --> E[Asset Loss]
```

**Why False Positive:**
1. Cross-chain rates use same bounded mechanisms
2. Rate providers must implement `IRateProvider` interface
3. Rate changes are monitored and bounded
4. Safe math operations prevent overflow
5. Authorization required for rate provider changes

### 3. Merkle Verification Bypass (FALSE POSITIVE)

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Attacker] --> B[Fake Merkle Proof]
    B --> C[ManagerWithMerkleVerification]
    C --> D[Unauthorized Access]
    D --> E[Asset Theft]
```

**Why False Positive:**
1. Merkle proofs are cryptographically secure
2. Each strategist has unique merkle root
3. Contract verifies both proof and call data
4. Flash loan operations protected by intent hashes
5. Authorization required for all operations

### 4. Delayed Withdraw Exploit (FALSE POSITIVE)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Attacker
    participant D as DelayedWithdraw
    participant V as Vault
    
    A->>D: Request Withdraw
    A->>V: Manipulate Rate
    D->>V: Get Rate
    V-->>D: Manipulated Rate
    D->>A: Excess Assets
```

**Why False Positive:**
1. Withdrawals have strict delay requirements
2. Rate changes are bounded
3. Contract uses safe math operations
4. Withdrawals have maximum loss limits
5. Third-party completion requires explicit permission

### 5. Teller Asset Manipulation (FALSE POSITIVE)

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Attacker] --> B[TellerWithMultiAssetSupport]
    B --> C[Asset Conversion]
    C --> D[Rate Manipulation]
    D --> E[Asset Loss]
```

**Why False Positive:**
1. Asset conversions protected by rate bounds
2. Contract uses safe math operations
3. All operations require proper authorization
4. Rate changes are monitored and bounded
5. Maximum loss limits prevent excessive value extraction

## Security Measures

1. **Access Control**
   - Role-based authorization
   - Merkle proof verification
   - Flash loan protection

2. **Rate Protection**
   - Bounded rate changes

3. **Withdrawal Safety**
   - Delay requirements
   - Maximum loss limits

4. **Asset Protection**
   - Rate bounds
